      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>Online intrusions refer to unauthorized access, interference, or attacks on digital systems, networks, or personal data.

      <h3>2. Malware Attacks – Specifically Worms</h3>
      <p>Malware is created for many reasons but most commonly it is used for stealing personal, financial, or business information. A common type of malware attack is through worms. A worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. It can replicate itself without any human interaction. Worms can be transmitted through software vulnerabilities, spam email attachments, or instant messaging links. Once opened, these links may lead to malicious websites or automatically install malware.</p>

      <h3>3. Phishing</h3>
      <p>Phishing is another common form of online intrusion. It involves attempts to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details. Attackers often pose as trusted sources to lure victims, much like a fisherman using bait to lure a catch.</p>

      <h3>4. Credential Stuffing</h3>
      <p>Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where hackers take stolen login details from one system and attempt to use them elsewhere. Because many users reuse usernames and passwords, attackers may gain access to multiple services using bots that try those credentials across popular sites.</p>
