<h1>Online Intrusions</h1>
<h2>Introducton</h2>

<p>Online intrusions refer to unauthorized access, interference, or attacks on digital systems, networks, or personal data. Some common types include malware attacks, phishing, denial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service attacks, brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and ransomware attacks.</p>

<h3>Malware attacks/ Specifically Worms</h3>

<p>Malware is created for many reasons but most commonly it is used for stealing personal, financial, or business information. A common type of malware attack is through worms. A worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. It can replicate itself without any human interaction. Worms can be transmitted through software vulnerabilities. They could even arrive as attachments in spam email, or through instant messaging (DMs). Once these links are open, they could open to a bad website or automatically download a worm onto your device.</p>




<h3>Phishing</h3>

<p>Phishing is another common form of online intrusion. Phishing is when there's an attempt to steal sensitive information, usually usernames, passwords, credit card information, bank account information, or any other important information. The attacker gets the victim's information by posing as a trusted source and making an appealing request, much like a fisherman using bait to lure in a catch.</p>



<h3>Credential Stuffing</h3>

<p>Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where hackers take stolen login details from one system and try to use them to access others. These attacks rely on the fact that many people reuse the same username and password for multiple accounts. So, if attackers have the information for one account, they may be able to log into others as well. The attackers take your information and have bots try to log in to any important website using your information.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It is very important to protect your devices against all online intrusions, as there are many dangers to having them. Online intrusions can be harmful because they are capable of launching multiple different kinds of attacks. To help prevent online intrusions, it's important to have good anti-virus software, never download suspicious email attachments, keep all software updated, regularly back up important files, and regularly scan your computer.</p>
