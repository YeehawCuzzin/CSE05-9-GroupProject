      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of security causes digital systems to be volatile and unsafe to browse.</li>
        <li>To ensure the safety of their users, developers use different measures to protect against threats to a digital system. 
</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What is System Security? <em>(Source: Florida Tech, 2024; GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</em></h3>
      <ul>
       <li>System security is defined as the precautions an organization takes to ensure its networks and resources are safe from downtime, interference or malicious intrusion.</li>
        <li>The goal of a digital security system is to provide integrity, secrecy, and availability to all its users.</li>
        <li>It is in the best interest of an organization to secure its digital systems so they work properly and are not accessed by unwanted individuals. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Threats to Digital Systems <em>(Sources: GeeksforGeeks, 2022; Impreva, 2024)</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Program Threats</strong> – Program threats include viruses, trojan horses, ransomware, etc. These programs were written by unautorized users to perform malicious or extortive acts. If successful, an attacker can gain ahold of an organizations entire system</li>
        <li><strong>Social threats</strong> – This threat involves social engineering. An attacker will convince a victim to install malware in order to gain sensitve information and then go on to act as someone else (ususally for money). </li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (Dos)</strong> – This attack sends the system a large volume of traffic, slowing all functions to a halt. Multiple devices sending these attacks are called Distributed DoS (DDoS).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Security Measures Taken <em>(Sources: GeeksforGeeks, 2022; Impreva, 2024)</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Security</strong> – All of the information the is vital to an organizations system runs through its network. Securing these network beforehand can help prevent harmful breaches in data.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Security</strong> – secure cloud storage can be a strong precaution against unwated attackers. Good cloud storage involves detecting and fixing false security configurations and vulnerbilities. </li>
        <li><strong>User Security</strong> – An organization's digital system is only as secure as its user's knowledge. Better education about threats and vulnerbilites can help ensure no user falls prey to social engineering attacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>System security is crucial for an organization's digital system. Without it, valuable information they posses is at risk of being seized by unwated cyberattackers.</li>
        <li>Proper security measures, constant maintenance, and user education will help prevent attacks.</li>
      </ul>
